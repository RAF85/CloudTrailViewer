# CloudTrail Viewer
CloudTrail Viewer is a Java Desktop Application for reading and analysing AWS CloudTrail Event logs.

**NOTE : 
The  code now in this repository is for Version 3 of the application.
While the application is still under development, the code should run and be usable within some limits.
It currently only handles loading files from the local file system, and there are many updates and tweaks
that need to done before I will create a release form it.**

**If you have come here looking for a working CloudTrail Viewer application you can download this from the
Releases tab.**
