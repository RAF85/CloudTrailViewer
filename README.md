CloudTrail Viewer is a Java Desktop Application for reading and analysing AWS CloudTrail Event logs.

There is currently no documentation for the application but I have put together a simple GitHub Pages website that provides a basic overview of the features, you can find that here : http://githublemming.github.io/CloudTrailViewer/

**Please Note**

While I'm making compiled Releases of the application available in the releases section, (so those non developers who can't, or don't want to run the application from code can use it), you will find the releases are not signed so you will need to know who to run un-signed applications for your operating system.
