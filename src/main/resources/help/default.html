        <h2>CloudTrail Viewer</h2>
        CloudTrail Viewer is a desktop application for viewing and analysing CloudTrail event files.
        
        <br/>
        <h3>Loading Events</h3>
        here are four ways you can load CloudTrail log files into the application these are:
        <ul>
            <li>Load complete event files from the local file system</li>
            <li>Load complete event files from a S3 bucket</li>
            <li>Load only API calls that match a specific criteria from the local file system</li>
            <li>Load only API calls that match a specific criteria from the local file system</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br/>
        <h2>Preferences</h2>
        <h3>AWS Accounts</h3>
        To load files from S3 you have to provide a set of IAM API keys, this is done on the AWS Tab of the Preferences Dialog.
        You can provide multiple sets of keys if you wish and switch between them when using the S3 FileChooser.

        <br/>
        <h3>AWS Aliases</h3>
        If you are logging multiple accounts into the same S3 bucket you need to remember which 12 digit account belongs to which one of your account.
        To help you you can enter an alias for the account number so when browsing an S3 bucket the alias will be displayed instead of the number.

        <br/>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        The security tab allows you to add and remove API calls that you wish to monitor that relate to potential security issues such as a 
        Securiy Group being opened to allows traffic in through unauthorised ports.

        <br/>
        <h3>Resources</h3>
        The resources tab allows you to add and removed API calls that related to resources, for example you might want to check when a new
        EC2 or RDS is created, or when an EC2 was stopped.
