# CloudTrail Viewer : Using the Source

To run the application this way, you will need to either clone or download the code.

## Compiling the source using maven
CloudTrail viewer is a Maven application. There is a good introduction to maven on their website
https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html. If you are not familiar with Maven then I 
suggest you read about maven.

+ First you need to compile the code : mvn compile
+ Then you create a .jar file to run : mvn package

## Compiling using an IDE
If you have a Java IDE such as Eclipse, Netbean or IntelliJ IDEA then you can create a new maven project and include
the downloaded source code.

Compile and run the code as you would any other Java project.
